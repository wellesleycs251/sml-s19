(* CS 251: ML Modules and Abstract Data Types *)

(* This signature hides gcd and reduce.  Clients cannot assume they
   exist or call them with unexpected inputs.  But clients can still
   build rational values directly with the constructors Whole and
   Frac.  This makes it impossible to maintain invariants about
   rationals, so we might have negative denominators, which some
   functions do not handle, and toString may print a non-reduced
   fraction. *)

(* This signature abstracts the rational type.  Clients can acquire
   values of type rational using make_frac and manipulate them using
   add and toString, but they have know way to inspect the
   representation of these values or create them on their own.  They
   are tightly sealed black boxes. This ensures that any invariants
   established and assumed inside an implementation of this signature
   cannot be violated by external code.

   This is a true Abstract Data Type. *)
